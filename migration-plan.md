### Phase 5: Complete Migration & Optimization ðŸ•’ PLANNED
- [ ] Remove all inline scripts
  - [ ] Move remaining DOM manipulation to components
  - [ ] Clean up Bridge connections
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
  - [ ] Optimize event handling
  - [ ] Add debouncing for expensive operations
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Integration tests for key flows
  - [ ] End-to-end tests for critical paths

## Implementation Strategy

For each component or feature:

1. **Analyze** existing code
2. **Bridge** component with existing functionality
3. **Create** new component using modular architecture
4. **Test** with both old and new code running
5. **Replace** old code with new component
6. **Verify** functionality is maintained

## Timeline Estimates

- Phase 1 (Architecture Foundation): âœ… COMPLETED
- Phase 2 (Core Components): 2 weeks
- Phase 3 (Form Fields & UI): 3 weeks
- Phase 4 (Service Layer): 2 weeks
- Phase 5 (Complete Migration): 2 weeks

## Success Criteria

1. All inline scripts migrated to modular architecture
2. No regression in functionality
3. Improved code maintainability
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Updated documentation
