# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Development-Only Features
- [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture Badge**: Automatically hidden in production
  - ✅ Badge has `dev-only` class
  - ✅ Positioned as floating badge in bottom-left corner (non-intrusive)
  - ✅ CSS rules hide `.dev-only` elements by default
  - ✅ JavaScript detects development environment (localhost, file://, ports 8080/3000/5000)
  - ✅ Badge only shows when `body.development` or `body.localhost` classes are present
  - ✅ Smooth entry animation with 2-second delay
  - ✅ Mobile responsive with icon-only display on small screens

### Environment Detection
The application automatically detects development environments based on:
- `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` hostname
- Development ports: 8080, 3000, 5000
- `file://` protocol (local files)
- `?dev=true` query parameter
- Empty hostname (local development)

### Production Deployment
When deployed to a production domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`), the Event-Driven Architecture badge will be automatically hidden.

### Manual Override
To force show development features in any environment, add `?dev=true` to the URL:
```
https://yourdomain.com/dashboard.html?dev=true
```

### Files Modified for Dev-Only Features
- `dashboard.html`: Added floating `dev-only` architecture badge in bottom-left corner
- `css/main.css`: Added CSS rules for floating badge positioning and animations
- `dashboard.js`: Added environment detection logic

### Testing
1. **Local Development**: Badge should be visible
   - http://localhost:8080/dashboard.html ✅ Badge visible
   
2. **Production Simulation**: Badge should be hidden
   - Change hostname in browser dev tools or test on actual domain ✅ Badge hidden

### Notes
- No manual configuration needed
- No build steps required to hide development features
- Automatic environment detection ensures clean production deployment
- Development tools remain accessible locally for ongoing development
