# Basic Netlify configuration file

[build]
  # Specifies the directory Netlify builds from and deploys.
  # "." means the root directory (where your index.html, dashboard.html are).
  publish = "."
  # Specifies where your Netlify Functions live.
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[dev]
  # Optional but good practice: Explicitly tell the dev server the same info.
  publish = "."
  functions = "netlify/functions"
